# Welcome to Coinly!
Coinly is an Android app that lets users set and claim prize items from friends through virtual coin transactions earned through good deeds.

## How it works
All you need to do to start giving or claiming prizes is create a profile. Do so by just adding a profile picture, your name, and bio! 

Then you'll be taken to the home page. You wont see anything at first, but it includes the following 4 sliding tabs in this order:
<ul>
  <li>Bigs</li>
  <li>Littles</li>
  <li>Linkup</li>
  <li>My Profile</li>
</ul>

Scroll down to the section below to learn more about what you can do in those tabs!

## Bigs 
On the Bigs tab, you will see the people who you claim prizes from. Tap on any one of your bigs and you'll be taken to their profile page where you can see the prizes that they have set for you! To claim a prize, just tap on the prize image and a timer will be set for the Big to award you the prize, given that you have enough coins to redeem. You'll also be able to see the prizes you've already claimed from them. If you'd like, you can remove this big from your connections. Lastly, you'll see "Request" and "Apeal" buttons on their profile; read the "How do coin transactions work?" section below to learn more.

## Littles
On the Littles tab, you will see the people for which you set prizes! Tap on any one of your Littles and you'll be taken to their profile page where you can see the prizes you've set for them, as well as the prizes they've already claimed. To set a prize, tap on the "set prize" button. Then, take a picture of the prize and set a title and price for it. Hit "set" and the new prize will be displayed on the screen inside a round image. If you'd like, you can remove this Little from your connections. Lastly, you'll see "Give" and "Revoke" buttons on their profile; read the "How do coin transactions work?" section below to learn more.

## Linkup
On the Linkup page, you can create new connections by finding new Bigs or Littles. Use the search bar to find someone you know, or explore by tapping on someone where their profile will be displayed. You'll see their bio and the prizes they've claimed or given, as well as the number of Bigs, Littles, and coins they've earned. Tap on the "add as big" or "add as little" button to send them a connection request. You'll be notified if they've accepted!

## My Profile
The last tab shows your profile where you can see the prizes you've claimed, how many coins you've earned, and how many Bigs and Littles you have. There's also an "Edit profile" button where you can make changes such as adding a new profile picture or editing your bio.

## How do coin transactions work?
For Littles: <br/>
You can only receive coins from your Big. If a Big sees you do something good, or a task they assigned you, like taking out the trash, they can award you coins. If you do something good, but your Big is not around, you can go to their profile and tap, "Request Coins". However, Bigs can also revoke coins from you for, lets say, forgetting to do a task or purposely doing something bad. As a Little, you can go to the Big's profile, however, and tap "Appeal" if you feel your coins have been revoked unfairly.

For Bigs: <br/>
You can give and revoke coins to your littles. Give coins when you see them do something good. Revoke otherwise. Complete these actions by going to the Little's profile and tapping the "Give" or "Revoke" buttons, respectively. 

## Claiming Prizes
Once you have earned enough coins, go to one of your Big's profile to see their prizes. Tap on a prize to claim it, make sure you have enough coins. Once you tap on the prize, the Big will have 24 hours to award you that prize. You must confirm in the app whether or not you've received the prize. If the Big has not awarded you the prize within 24 hours, the Big's coin count will be set to 0, with an account suspension of 1 month.
