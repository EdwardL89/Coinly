# Welcome to Coinly!
Coinly is an Android app that lets users set and claim prize items from friends through virtual coin transactions earned through good deeds.

## How it works
All you need to do to start giving or claiming prizes is create a profile. Do so by just adding a profile picture, your name, and bio! 

Then you'll be taken to the home page. You wont see anything at first, but it includes the following 4 sliding tabs in this order:
<ul>
  <li>Bigs</li>
  <li>Littles</li>
  <li>Linkup</li>
  <li>My Profile</li>
</ul>

Scroll down to the section below to learn more about what you can do in those tabs!

## Bigs 
On the Bigs tab, you will see the people who you claim prizes from.

## Littles
On the Littles tab, you wil see the people you set prizes for and they claim those prizes from you!

## Linkup
On the Linkup page, you can create new connections by finding new Bigs or Littles on this page.

## My Profile
The last tab shows your profile where you can see the prizes you've claimed, how many coins you've earned, and how many Bigs and Littles you have.
